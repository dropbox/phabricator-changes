    // There is a distinction between a "diff" and a "revision". A "revision" is a logical change that you might link
    // to (eg DXXXX), and a "diff" is a single update posted to the revision. When you look at a revision, there's a

    // commits" which have hashes for the commit and the tree associated with them, but the actual diff content is just
    // a patch file. The commits aren't actually upload or accessible individually. These hashes (both for commit and
    // for tree) are cached on the revision for quick access. Therefore if we want to find a diff that contains a commit
    // with a given commit hash, we have to first look at all revisions that contain that hash, then look at all of the
